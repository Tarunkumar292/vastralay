        <h4>OLIMP NUTRITION CREATINE MONOHYDRATE CREAPURE - 500 GRAMS</h4>
        <p class="detail-color">
          OLIMP CREATINE MONOHYDRATE CREAPURE is a micronised form of creatine
          which has better solubility and better tissue absorptiveness than the
          traditional monohydrate. Creatine molecule is the basic energy vehicle
          in muscle cells, as a phosphate stores high-energy phosphoric acid
          groups (phosphate radicals) and distributes them for protein synthesis
          and muscle fibre contractions. Diet supplementation with OLIMP
          CREATINE MONOHYDRATE results in: - rapid re-synthesis of ATP (direct
          energy source) - substantial increase in strength and lean muscle mass
          - anti-catabolic effects - increased energy saturation of the body
        </p>
        <p class="detail-color">
          Only for adults, especially strength and endurance athletes.

        <h4>Additional description</h4>
        <p class="detail-color">
          Creatine certainly has the potential to enhance muscular development.
          Purchasing the right creatine supplement may be able to ensure those
          interested in achieving their physique improvement goals can do so.
          Creapure Monohydrate might be one of the best products on the market
          since it offers a high efficiency in which the body can absorb helpful
          creatine. The solubility and tissue absorption capabilities of this
          product are among the best consumers will find on the market. For that
          reason alone, investing in this supplement is strongly recommended.
        </p>
        <p class="detail-color">
          Creatine molecules offer a tremendous source of energy for the muscle
          cells. Among the reasons for this would be the fact creatine helps
          phosphate radicals be removed from storage and distributed through the
          muscle cells allowing for maximum strength, recovery, and muscle
          building gains
        </p>
        <p class="detail-color">
          When you take a serving of Creapure Monohydrate, you can feel
          confident all these benefits will be maximized. A mere 5 grams serving
          size is capable of delivering these much sought after results. One
          single container offers a full 100 servings further ensuring the
          investment made on this particular supplement would be a good one.
